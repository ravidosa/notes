truth: either true or false
	preconditions
	relative truth
	generalizations
	disjunction (see [Logic](Logic%20and%20Proofs.md))
	compositionality
	ambiguity/underspecificity
modeling
	language as conventional system
		convention = conformity + arbitrariness
	most certain principle
		if different truth values in some possible situation, different meanings
	truth-conditional semantics
		systematic association of sentence and truth condition
		ambiguity, sentences without truth condition
	principle of compositionality
		whole is function of parts, syntactic combination
		extension: meaning of sentence in a specific context
		intension: mapping of context to meaning
	principle of verification
		factually significant if understanding how to verify
	indirect interpretation
		formal language between natural language and theory of semantics
implication
	A implies B (in context C): if A said in context C by trusted speaker, listener will assume B to be true
	entailment
		A entails B: if A, then B (in all contexts)
	contradiction
		A contradicts B/B contradicts A: if A, not B and if B, not A (cannot both be true/false)
	contrary
		A contrary to B/B contrary to A: not A or not B (cannot both be true)
	equivalent
		A equivalent to B/B equivalent to A: A entails B and B entails A (both true/false)
	presupposition
		A implies B even in entailment cancelling environments
		projection test: negation/antecedent of a conditional/maybe
	cancellability
		explicit cancellability: B cancellable if A does not contradict ~B
		contextual cancellability: B cancellable if A implies B in one context but does not in another
		entailments not cancellable
	implicature
		A implies B, but fails defeasibility/reinforcement tests
		defeasibility test: if explicitly cancellable, implicature
		reinforcement test: redundant to say both
argument
	conclusion presented as result of premises
	valid: premises entail conclusion
	sound: valid and premises true
