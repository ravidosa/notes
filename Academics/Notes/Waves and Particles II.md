double slit experiment
	beam of photons form interference pattern at two slits
	electrons behave similarly
particle waves
	wave packet
	amplitude is related to probability of finding electron at that point ($P(x) \propto a_{wave}^2$)
davisson-germer experiment
	incident beam of electrons reflected at certain angles from surface of nickel crystal
	$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$ (de Broglie relation)
bragg diffraction
	$n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta$
matter waves
	wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$
	probability density $P = |\Psi(x,t)|^2 = \Psi^*(x,t)\Psi(x,t) = \operatorname{Re}(\Psi^2) + \operatorname{Im}(\Psi^2)$
	integrate over region in space/time
	schrodinger equation
		$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\delta^2\Psi(x,t)}{\delta x^2} = i\hbar \frac{\delta\Psi(x,t)}{\delta t}$ for $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$
		$\Psi(x,t) = Ae^{i(kx-wt)}$ for wavenumber $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$, angular frequency $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f$
		represents classical kinetic energy of particle
		normalization
			$\int\Psi^*\Psi dx = A^2$
			$A^2$ probability per unit length of finding particle
			for one particle
				$\int\Psi^*\Psi dx = 1$
heisenberg uncertainty principle
	uncertainty â†’ differing results for measured quantity
	gaussian distribution
	$\frac{1}{N} \frac{dN}{dx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_x^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma_x^2}}$
	$\Delta x \Delta p_x \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$ for individual uncertainties in position and momentum
	cannot simultaneously have perfect knowledge of both position and momentum
	rarely approached with current instruments
	independent for directions (x, y, z)
	$\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$ for individual uncertainties in energy and time
bohr model of hydrogen
	$E_n = -\frac{me^4}{2(4\pi\epsilon_0)\hbar^2}\frac{1}{n^2} = -\frac{13.6}{n^2} eV$ for integer $n$
	lowest level 13.6 eV binding energy
