transcript
	balance between selectivity and comprehensivity
	reflect hypotheses
	orthography
		modify to fit context
	formatting
		top-to-bottom bias
			utterances seen in context of previous utterances
		left-to-right bias
			influence of eurropean literacy
			dominance of one subject over other
			temporal prioritization, initiator
		verbal bias
			nonverbal and verbal components jointly communicate
			no well-developed, concise notation system for nonverbal
			practical vs theoretical
			different prioritization in different contexts
