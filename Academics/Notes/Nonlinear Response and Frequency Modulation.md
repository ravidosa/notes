linear operations canâ€™t add new frequencies not present in original signal
nonlinear operation
	$h(f(t))=a_af(t)+a_2f^2(t) + \ldots$
product of two terms gives difference and sum
beat mixer
	multiplication
	exponential adder
		$v_{out} \propto e^\frac{v_1+v_2}{V_T}-1$ (taylor expand)
	meaningful for delta function/sine wave
frequency content
	$\omega_1, \omega_2, 2\omega_1, 2\omega_2, \omega_1 + \omega_2, \omega_1 - \omega_2, \ldots$
ring modulator mixer
	isolate input and output voltages, allow carrier wave to drive central position
	net current switches signs
amplitude vs frequency modulation
