solution strategies
	interpretation of equation
	separation of variables
	graphical method
		phase line: rates of change
	fixed/equilibrium points: $u(t) = 0$
		stability analysis
			stable fixed point: $\frac{df}{du} \vert_{u=u^*} < 0$
			unstable fixed point: $\frac{df}{du} \vert_{u=u^*} > 0$
	bifurcation diagrams
		saddle-node bifurcation: two fixed points get closer, merge into single point and disappear
			$\frac{dx}{dt} = r-x^2$
		transcritical bifurcations: two fixed points exchange stabilities
			$\frac{dx}{dt} = x(r-x)$
		pitchfork bifurcations: pitchfork shaped, like saddle-node and transcritical combined
			supercritical
				$\frac{dx}{dt} = rx-x^3$
			subcritical
				$\frac{dx}{dt} = rx+x^3$
			hysteresis
