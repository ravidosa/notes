atomic levels form bands
electrons are fermions → no two in same quantum state
raising temperature smears distribution
conduction of current leads to gap jumping, holes
doping
	add more electrons (n-type), absorb electrons (p-type)
	shift energy bands relative to fermi level
if n-type next to p-type, region depletes, equilibrium
	forward bias (increase p-type potential) → current flows left to right
	diode (only lets current flow one way)
	$I = I_S(e^{\frac{V}{nk_B\frac{T}{e}}}-1) = I_S(e^{\frac{V}{V_T}}-1)$
	$V = V_T\ln(\frac{I}{I_S}+1)$
	room temp silicon
		saturation current $I_S = 10^{-12} A$
		threshold voltage $V_T = 0.6V$
current grows very quickly
	forward bias vs back bias
nonlinear
zener diodes
	current flows backward at a a certain voltage
