This repository contains my lecture notes and assignments for my undergraduate (primarily upper division) linguistics, mathematics, and physics coursework at the University of California, Davis. Disclaimer: These lecture notes are prepared firstly for my own reference; I make no guarantees about their completeness or utility as a study guide for people who are not me. I also emphasize that these notes are intended as a supplement to the lecture content and are not a replacement for attending class. I further do not condone any academic misconduct that involves the resources present in this repository; not only are the solutions (and any mistakes they may contain) my own, but to quote David Morin:

> Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with putting a problem aside for a while and coming back to it later. Indeed, this is probably the best way to learn things. If you head to the solution at the first sign of not being able to solve a problem, then you have wasted the problem.

Learning takes time and effort, and there are no shortcuts to understanding material at the level of complexity present here. Please ensure, for your sake as much as my own, that my work is treated with care.
