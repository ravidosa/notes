# Theory of Computation
automata theory: solvable with optimal efficiency
	regular expressions
		sum of character counts, but not difference of character counts
computational complexity theory: solvable efficiently
	path touring graph
		eulerian (all edges), but not hamiltonian (all nodes)
computability theory: solvable
	multivariate polynomials
	real solution, but not integer solution
