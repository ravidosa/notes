# Force
## Properties and Effects of Forces
newtonâ€™s laws
	body at rest tends to stay at rest, body in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by external unbalanced force
	acceleration of center of mass is net force divided by mass ($\vec{a}_{cm} = \frac{\vec{F}_{net}}{m} = \frac{\sum\vec{F}}{m}$)
	for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction ($\vec{F}_{A\to B} = \vec{F}_{B\to A}$)
free body diagrams
	forces acting on system, not by system
## Types of Forces
gravity
	$\vec{F}_{gravity} = m\vec{g}$
tension (massless strings = force transmission)
	forces equal on both sides for massless string
normal (contact) force
	balancing force, magnitude depends on other forces
friction
	kinetic friction (if sliding)
		$f_k = \mu_kN$ for normal force with magnitude $N$ and coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_k$
	static friction (if not sliding)
		$f_s \leq \mu_sN$ for normal force with magnitude $N$ and coefficient of static friction $\mu_s$
		if $f_s > \mu_sN$, object slips and force becomes kinetic
	$\mu_s > \mu_k$
	air resistance/drag
		cross sectional area, speed, air density
	elastic (spring) force
		$\vec{F}_{elastic} = -k\Delta\vec{x}$
