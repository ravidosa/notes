### Symmetry of Plane Figures
bilateral (reflection) vs rotational symmetry vs translational symmetry vs glide symmetry
### Isometries
isometry: distance-preserving map (rigid motion) of plane
orthogonal linear operators, translations, composition of isometries
symmetry: carries subset $F$ of plane to itself (set-wise)
	set of symmetries form subgroup of isometries
### Isometries of the Plane
linear operators
	translation $t_a = x + a = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}a_1 \\ a_2\end{bmatrix}$
	rotation $\rho_{\theta} = \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}$
	reflection about $e_1$ axis $r = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}$
	isometry of form $t_a\rho_{\theta}$ (rotation about point) or $t_a\rho_{\theta}r$ (glide, glide line parallel to line of reflection of $\rho_{\theta}r$)
	orientation-preserving: takes front to front (translation, rotation)
	orientation-reversing: doesn't (reflection, glide reflection)
### Finite Groups of Orthogonal Operators on the Plane
finite subgroup of orthogonal group $O_2$ (subgroup of $GL_2$ with orthonormal columns) is either:
	cyclic group $C_n$ generated by $\rho_{\theta}$ where $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{n}$
		order $n$
	dihedral group $D_n$ generated by $\rho_{\theta}$ and $r$ about line through origin
		order $2n$
		$D_n = \langle x, y | x^n, y^2, xyxy \rangle$
		$D_3 \approx S_3$
$O_2$ semi-direct product of rotation, reflection
	commute at cost of conjugating
subgroup $\Gamma$ of $\mathbb{R}^+$ discrete if for all $c \in \Gamma$, $|c| \geq \epsilon$ for some $\epsilon > 0$
	either $\{0\}$ or $a\mathbb{Z}$
fixed point theorem: for every element of finite group of isometries, point on the plane mapped to self
	isometries carry centroids to centroids
### Discrete Groups of Isometries
group of isometries of $\mathbb{R}^2$ denoted $\mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{R}^2)$
	isometries of vector space $\mathbb{V}$ (structure of vector addition) preserve metric $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$
homomorphism from $\varphi : \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{V}) \to O(\mathbb{V})$, kernel is subgroup of translations
tiling: periodic, tiles not infinitesimal
group of isometries is discrete if no arbitrarily small translations/rotations
	$|a| \geq \epsilon$, $|\theta| \geq \epsilon$
	translation subgroup $T$ of translation vectors
	point group $\overline{G}$ subgroup of $O(2)$
	glide reflection/glide
	either $L = \{0\}$, $L = \mathbb{Z}a$, $L = \mathbb{Z}a + \mathbb{Z}b$ (lattices)
crystallographic restriction: discrete subgroup $\Lambda$ of $\mathbb{V}$, group of symmetries of $\Lambda$ $\mathrm{Sym}(\Lambda)$
	$H$ subgroup of $\mathrm{Sym}(\Lambda)$,  rotations of order $1, 2, 3, 4, 6$,  either $C_n, D_n$ where $n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}$
### Plane Crystallographic Group
look for rotational symmetries to identify $n$
$D_n$ if reflection/glide symmetries, $C_n$ otherwise
### Abstract Symmetry: Group Operations
operation of group $G$ on set $S$: map of $G \times S \to S$
	identity, associativity
	free: only identity in stabilizer
	transitive: only one orbit
	permutation: bijective operation
	orbit $O_s$: set of elements of $S$ that element maps to
		partition $S$
	stabilizer $G_s$: set of elements of $G$ that maps element to itself
		subgroup of $G$
		$as = bs$ iff $a^{-1}b \in G_s$
		stabilizer of mapped element is conjugate subgroup
### The Operation on Cosets
operation of group on set of cosets is transitive
stabilizer of coset is subgroup
orbit-stabilizer theorem: bijective map between quotient group of stabilizer and orbit
### The Counting Formula
counting formula: $|G| = |G_s||O_s|$, $|S| = \sum_k |O_k|$
