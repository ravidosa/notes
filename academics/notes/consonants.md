# Consonants
IPA has chart has shaded areas to represent "impossible" sounds
environment introduces variation
	contrastive sounds
positional and dialectical variation indicated using diacritics
## Stop Consonants
consonants: speech sounds produced with obstruction in vocal tract
stops/plosives: complete stop of airflow
	location of constriction is place of articulation
	obstruction increases air pressure behind constriction, release burst with energy across spectrum
formant transitions
	middle of vowels stable, curve at edges
	specific to consonant + vowel combo
stop voicing
	affect formant transitions, release burst, voicing timing
	voicing onset time (VOT): diff in time between release of stop and beginning of voicing
		before release
			negative VOT
			voiced stop
			no/very small release burst
			complete formant transitions
		at stop
			zero VOT
			voiceless stop
			small release burst
			complete formant transitions
		after release
			positive VOT
			aspirated stop
			incomplete formant transitions
dependent on articulator timing
## Fricatives
fricatives: partial stop of airflow
	exhalation creates pressure difference, airflow
	location of constriction is place of articulation
	turbulent air source of voiceless fricatives
		cavity acts as filter, shapes noise into fricative
		longer cavity, more low frequency energy, more back of vocal tract
	some hit teeth, become louder
	voicing at larynx
		result from periodic source, noise, vocal tract filter
		less noise, some energy goes to voicing
		more noise energy at high frequencies compared to vowels
	characterized by noise, high frequency energy
usually bilabial or labiodental fricatives
apical (tongue tip) vs laminal (tongue blade)
## Sonorants
approximants: less closure than stops + fricatives, more than vowels
	no turbulence, similar acoustically to vowels
	/ w r l j / in english, gradual transitions
		/ w j / semi vowels, similar to / u i / (shorter, quieter)
		/ r / unique for very low F3 (< 2000 Hz)
		/ l / only lateral approximant
			tongue only touches one side (similar to nasals)
			zeros/anti formants of no energy
nasals/nasal stops: stops produced with lowered velum
	opens nasal cavity, airflow without oral cavity open
	almost always voiced, louder + more melodious (with pitch) than voiced stops
	more complicated acoustics, formant discontinuities/zeros
