planck relation
	$E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \mathrm{eV\cdot nm}}{\lambda}$ for $h = 6.626 * 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}$
photoelectric effect
	monochromatic light on electrode
	current flow above certain frequency
	current stop above certain voltage
	$K_e = eV_{stop}=hf - \phi$
photon momentum
	$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = pc$, so $p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$
compton scattering
	high energy photon hits electron
	loss of energy from photon to electron
	$\lambda'-\lambda = \frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\cos\theta)$
	compton wavelength of electron is 2.43 pm (when $\theta = 0$)
bremsstrahlung
	high energy electron accelerated after passing by electric field of nucleus
	accelerated charges radiate photons
$e^+e^-$ pair conversion
	high energy (twice rest mass energy of electron) photon turns into electron positron pair after passing by heavy nucleus
	creates antimatter
matter-antimatter annihilation
	positron and electron form positronium, annihilate into two photons (~0.125 ns)
photon hits matter, energy absorbed by photoelectric effect, compton scattering, $e^+e^-$ pair conversion
electromagnetic showers
	initial photon creates $e^+e^-$ pair, which create bremsstrahlung photons, and so on
	determine energy of gamma ray
wave/particle nature of light
	photons are like wave packets
	quantum uncertainty
		no definite position or wavelength
		properties of both particle and wave
