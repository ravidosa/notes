# Polynomials

polynomial ring $R[x]$
	field of rational functions $R(c)$ generated from polynomial ring by addition, multiplication
monic: leading coefficient is $1$
division algorithm for polynomials
	$a(x) - b(x)q(r) + r(x)$ (polynomial long division)
	euclidean algorithm for polynomials to find gcd of polynomials
		$g(x) = \lambda(x)a(x) + \mu(x)b(x)$
		more interesting and nicer in finite fields
	factorizing polynomials
		irreducible: not constant, cannot be expressed as product of non-constant polynomials
			the primes of polynomials
			all linear polynomials irreducible
		non constant polynomial can be expressed uniquely as product of irreducible polynomials
		$(x - \alpha)$ divisor iff $\alpha$ is root in $F[x]$
			non-prime fields have more roots
