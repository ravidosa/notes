# Field
field $F$
	commutative under $+$
	commutative under $\times$ excluding additive identity
	multiplication distributes over addition
	ring with commutative multiplication, only $0$ non-invertible
	characteristic: order of $1$
		either prime (finite) or zero (infinite)
extension field $K / F$
	algebraic: root of monic polynomial with coefficients in field (transcendental otherwise)
		elements of field algebraic
		algebraic if substitution homomorphism not injective
		irreducible polynomial for $\alpha$ over $F$
			monic of lowest degree with $\alpha$ as root
			canonical map is isomorphism
				isomorphism between $F(\alpha), F(\beta)$ iff irreducible polynomials equal
			$F(\alpha)$ is smallest subfield of $K$ containing $F$ and $\alpha$
				powers are basis as vector space
			find by taking powers, eliminating
			$F[x]/(f)$ extension field of $F$
				polynomial splits completely if only linear factors
					every monic polynomial splits completely in some field extension
					splitting field: split completely and generated by roots
						if irreducible with root, then splits completely
				multiple root iff factor of $f, f'$
					multiple root in some field extension iff $f, f'$ not relatively prime
					no multiple root in any field extension unless derivative $0$
					if characteristic zero, no multiple root in any field extension
	degree $[K : F]$ is dimension of $K$ as $F$-vector space
		finite extension if finite (quadratic if degree $2$, etc)
			degree $1$ iff $F = K, \alpha \in F$
		multiplies ($[L : F] = [L : K][K : F]$)
	separable extension
		minimal polynomial of every element separable (nonzero derivative, no repeated roots)
		if characteristic zero/finite, all extensions separable
	primitive element: generates field
		if generated by $\alpha, \beta$, $\gamma = \alpha + c\beta$ is generator for all but finite $c$
classes of fields
	number fields: subfields of $\mathbb{C}$, extension field of $\mathbb{Q}$
	finite field
		extension of prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$ ($q = p^r$)
			$\mathbb{Z}_m$ field iff $m$ prime
			irreducible factors of $x^q - x$, polynomials of degree less than $r$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_p$
			frobenius automorphism: $(x + y)^q = x^q + y^q$
	function field: extension of field of rational functions
## Galois Theory
galois group $G(K/F)$
	$F$-automorphisms of $K$ (fixed on $F$)
	galois extension if order of galois group equals degree
	roots mapped to roots
		if generators fixed, identity map
		unique root map
normal basis: conjugates of generator linearly independent
fixed field: subfield $K^H$ with elements of field $K$ fixed by group of automorphisms $H$
	$H = G(K/K^H)$
	irreducible polynomial of element is product of elements in $H$-orbit
	extension field algebraic if every element algebraic
		if not finite, some elements with arbitrarily large degrees
	fixed field theorem: $[K : K^H] = |H|$
	luroth's theorem: subfield of complex rational functions isomorphic to field of complex rational functions
galois extension
	intermediate field $F \subset L \subset K$, proper if $L \neq F, K$
		$G(K/L) \subset G(K/F)$
		galois group order divides $[K : F]$, $K$ is galois extension of $K^H$ with galois group $H$
	$|G| = [K : F]$ iff $K^G = F$ iff $K$ splitting field over $F$
	finite extension contained galois, $K$ is galois extension of $L$ and $G(K / L) \leq G(K / F)$
main theorem: bijective correspondence between subgroups of $G$, intermediate fields
	maps $H$ to $K^H$, $L$ to $G(K/L)$
	$L \subset L'$ iff $H' \subset H$ (inclusions reversed)
	finite field extension has finitely many intermediate fields
	$L / F$ galois extension iff $H \unlhd G$
## Arithmetic
treat as polynomials, addition as expected, multiplication mod irreducible polynomial
irreducible polynomial of degree $k$
	use PIE
	[necklace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necklace_(combinatorics)): $n$-character string of length $k$ (rotations equivalent)
		$N_k(n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{d|n} \varphi(d)k^{n/d}$
		equivalent to number of irreducible polynomials of degree $k$ over $\mathbb{F}_n$
		chebotarev density theorem: over $\mathbb{Q}$, nonramified prime factorization same as frobenius cycle type
	factorizing polynomial
		primitive polynomial: gcd of coefficients is $1$
			gauss' lemma: product of primitive is primitive
		linear, quadratic, etc factors
