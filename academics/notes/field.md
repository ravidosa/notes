# Field
field $F$
	commutative under $+$
	commutative under $\times$ excluding additive identity
	multiplication distributes over addition
	ring with commutative multiplication, only $0$ non-invertible
extension field $K / F$
	algebraic: root of monic polynomial with coefficients in field (transcendental otherwise)
		elements of field algebraic
		algebraic if substitution homomorphism not injective
		irreducible polynomial for $\alpha$ over $F$
			monic of lowest degree with $\alpha$ as root
			canonical map is isomorphism
				isomorphism between $F(\alpha), F(\beta)$ iff irreducible polynomials equal
			$F(\alpha)$ is smallest subfield of $K$ containing $F$ and $\alpha$
				powers are basis as vector space
			find by taking powers, eliminating
			$F[x]/(f)$ extension field of $F$
				polynomial splits completely if only linear factors
					every monic polynomial splits completely in some field extension
					splitting field: split completely and generated by roots
						if irreducible with root, then splits completely
				multiple root iff factor of $f, f'$
					multiple root in some field extension iff $f, f'$ not relatively prime
					no multiple root in any field extension unless derivative $0$
					if characteristic zero, no multiple root in any field extension
	degree $[K : F]$ is dimension of $K$ as $F$-vector space
		finite extension if finite (quadratic if degree $2$, etc)
			degree $1$ iff $F = K, \alpha \in F$
		multiplies ($[L : F] = [L : K][K : F]$)
	separable extension
		minimal polynomial of every element separable (nonzero derivative, no repeated roots)
		if characteristic zero/finite, all extensions separable
	primitive element: generates field
		if generated by $\alpha, \beta$, $\gamma = \alpha + c\beta$ is generator for all but finite $c$
	galois group
		$F$-automorphisms of $K$ (fixed on $F$)
		galois extension if order of galois group equals degree
		roots mapped to roots
			if generators fixed, identity map
			unique root map
classes of fields
	number fields: subfields of $\mathbb{C}$, extension field of $\mathbb{Q}$
	finite field
		extension of prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$ ($q = p^r$)
			$\mathbb{Z}_m$ field iff $m$ prime
			irreducible factors of $x^q - x$, polynomials of degree less than $r$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_p$
			frobenius automorphism: $(x + y)^q = x^q + y^q$
	function field: extension of field of rational functions
## Arithmetic
treat as polynomials, addition as expected, multiplication mod irreducible polynomial
