# Partial Differential Equation
linear homogenous PDE
	linear comb of solutions is also solution
	$\nabla^2 U = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}U + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}U + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}U$
elliptic: involves $u_{xx}, u_{yy}$
	$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = f(x, y)$ (poisson)
		$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0$ (laplace)
		dirichlet boundary condition: inside determined by boundary
