# Orthogonality
## Orthogonal Vectors and Matrices
if vectors orthogonal, then linearly independent
	orthonormal: $Q^TQ = I$
orthonormal: all 2-norms are $1$
orthogonal matrix: $Q^TQ = I$, full rank
	product of orthogonal is orthogonal
	euclidean length invariant under orthogonal transformation
projector $P = P^2$ (idempotent)
	complementary projector $P^{\perp} = I - P$
	orthogonal projector $P = P^T$
	range and null of each other
	$\mathbb{R}^m$ decomposition into $\mathrm{range}(P) + \mathrm{null}(P)$
		unique vector decomposition
