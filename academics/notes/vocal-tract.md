# The Vocal Tract
vocal tract: all parts of body used in producing speech
	abdominal muscles, lips, nostrils, tongue
analysis done by mri, mid-sagittal section
sub-laryngeal system (below larynx)
	get air moving
	pulmonic airstream mechanism (lungs)
		air drawn into lungs, then pushed out
		diaphragm: largest muscle used for speech
		speech generally exhalation (pulmonic egressive)
laryngeal system (larynx)
	control pitch and voicing
	trachea: tube connecting mouth and lungs
		cricoid cartilage: top ring,  thickened
		vocal folds: can cover opening to trachea
			vocal ligament
		cartilage: cricoid, thyroid, arytenoid
			control position of vocal folds
				voicing
			faster vibration, higher pitch
		pharynx: open space at back of mouth, greater freedom of tongue movement
supra-laryngeal system (above larynx)
	shape and constrict air
	active articulators
		lips, tongue front,  tongue body, tongue root
	passive articulators
		upper lip, upper teeth, alveolar ridge, hard/soft palate, velar port,  pharyngeal wall
	oral tract (mouth)
	nasal tract (nose)
