# Collision
## Classical Mechanics
mass and momentum always conserved
elastic collision: kinetic energy conserved
	$\Delta K = 0$, $\Delta E_{thermal} = 0$
inelastic collision
	sticky (decrease in kinetic) vs explosive (increase in kinetic)
	perfectly inelastic: stuck together, max drop in kinetic energy
		all mechanical energy becomes thermal in center of mass frame
	$\Delta E_{thermal} > 0$
### Strategies
analyze problem in center of mass frame
2d â†’ split along axes
	$\cos\theta = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \frac{m_2}{m_1})\frac{v_2}{v_1}$
	if masses equal $\theta = 90$, if moving less mass $\theta > 90$
## Relativistic Mechanics
energy and momentum always conserved
elastic collision: kinetic energy, rest energy, and mass conserved
inelastic collision
	sticky (decrease in kinetic, increase in rest energy and mass) vs explosive (increase in kinetic, decrease in rest energy and mass)
### Strategies
classical strategies
use invariant $E^2 - p^2c^2 = m^2c^4$ to get energy from momentum (or vice versa)
use $v = \frac{pc^2}{E}$ to get velocity from energy, momentum
use invariant dot product of [four-vectors](four-vector.md)
