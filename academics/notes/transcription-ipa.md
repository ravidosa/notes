## Phonetics
phonetics: understanding speech chain
1. speaker decides to communicate idea
2. speaker carries out motor plan to create specific sound
	articulatory phonetics
		how sound produced in vocal tract
		anatomy/physiology of vocal tract
		neural control of articulation
3. sound has specific characteristics, travels through air to listener
	acoustic phonetics
		description of speech sounds
4. sound arrives at listener ear, analyzed by inner ear
5. ear relays information to brain
	hearing and speech perception
		form and function of peripheral auditory system
		sounds to neural signals
		processing on way to brain
6. brain analyzes information, activates region of brain
	recognition and learning
		speech sounds stored in brain
		perceptual qualities
		distinguishing sounds perceptually
descriptive vs prescriptive approach
## Articulation
language is discrete, combinatorial, unbounded
	words made from small set of sounds, open ended, reusable
	describe speech production in terms of gestures, articulators
speech production
1. air pushed out by lungs
2. airflow modulated by larynx
3. air shaped by vocal tract
4. air radiates from mouth
speaking is breathing + obstruction of air
	changes in airflow result in sound
speech processes
	airstream process
		source of energy for speech sound
		pulmonic egressive by default (unmarked)
	laryngeal process
		action/state of vocal folds
		voiced/voiceless, aspiration, glottal stops
	oronasal process
		velum determines flow through nose/mouth
		lowered = nasal, raised = oral
	articulatory process
		articulators: lips, tongue, larynx
		consonants: constriction along vocal tract
			place: labial, coronal, dorsal, laryngeal (subcategories)
			manner: nasal, plosive, affricate, fricative, approximant, etc
			voiced: voiced, voiceless
		vowels: no significant blockage
			height: low, mid, back
			frontness: front, central, back
			rounding: rounded, unrounded
## Transcription
writing: graphic representation of language using symbols
	tool based on shared knowledge
	developed and maintained
	not spontaneous
	orthography: conventional writing system for language
		not used, inconsistent
phones
	aka segments
	individual speech sounds
	combine into syllables -> words -> sentences
international phonetic alphabet [(IPA)](https://www.ipachart.com/)
	contains enough symbols to describe all speech sounds
	consonants organization
		place of articulation (lips -> glottis, L -> R)
		manner of articulation (most -> least constricted, T -> B)
		voice (left voiceless, right voiced)
		mostly discrete, relatively similar across languages
	vowel organization (vowel quadrilateral)
		frontness (more -> less, L -> R)
		height (more -> less, T -> B)
		roundness (left unrounded, right rounded)
		more continuous, vowel quality
		primary cardinal on outside, secondary on inside
		usually 5 vowels, three heights + 2 frontnesses
		closest common symbols for vowel
