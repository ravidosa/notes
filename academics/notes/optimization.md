# Optimization
minimum/maximum of objective function over set
univariate
	calculus minimization problem
multivariate
	linear optimization
linear programming problem (standard form)
	decision variables: variables to be optimized ($x_i$)
	objective function: linear function to be maximized ($\zeta = \sum_i c_ix_i$)
	constraints: boundaries on decision variables ($\sum_i a_{mi}x_i \leq b_m$)
		positivity constraint: sign of decision variable ($x_i \geq 0$)
	solution: choice of decision variables
		feasible solution: satisfies all constraints
			optimal solution: feasible solution that maximizes objective function (not always existent/unique)
	feasible problem: at least one feasible solution
	infeasible problem: no feasible solutions
	unbounded problem: feasible solution with arbitrarily large values, no optimal solution
	bounded problem: not unbounded
