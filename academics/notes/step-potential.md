incident, reflected, transmitted
	inc refl same wavelength, trans longer + lower energy
	probability ($E > U_0$)
		$T = \frac{\sqrt{E(E-U_0)}}{(\sqrt{E} + \sqrt{E-U_0})^2}$, $R = \frac{(\sqrt{E} - \sqrt{E-U_0})^2}{(\sqrt{E} + \sqrt{E-U_0})^2}$
		finite barrier
			resonant transmission: $k'L = n\pi$
	if $E < U_0$, no transmission, fully reflection
		penetration of barrier
	finite barrier, $E > U_0$
		probabilities for transmission and reflection
			same wavelength before and after (longer in barrier), lowered amplitude
		resonant transmission
			$E - U_0 = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$
boundary conditions
	bound has discrete energies, unbound has any energy greater than $U_0$
	$v \propto k$
