# Rectangular Potential Barrier
see [Schrodinger Equation](schrodinger-equation.md)
$E < U_0$
same wavelength before and after (longer in barrier), lowered amplitude
particle tunneled through barrier
bigger barrier, smaller tunneling probability
$T \approx 16\frac{E}{U_0}(1-\frac{E}{U_0})e^{-2L\sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar}(U_0-E)}}$
