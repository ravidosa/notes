# Issues in Language Universals and Typology
typology: classification of languages based on shared formal characteristics
	compatible with any grammatical theory in principle
	cross-linguistic patterns, connections
	formal features convey meaning
classification types
	genetic (common origin)
		areal features: shared by location, not necessarily from proto-language
	typological (common features)
		phonological
			usually 5 vowels
			majority 3-9
			most common: a, i, u
		morphological
			analytic: isolating (mostly dependent on word order)
			synthetic: fusion vs polysynthetic vs agglutinative (heavy particle usage)
		syntactic
			mostly SVO, SOV
		semantic
			construction of phrases
		pragmatic
language universals
	certain core properties of all languages
	absolute: all languages have property
	implicational: if property, then second property
	explanation
		common genetic origin: speculative, untestable
		innateness: chomsky, empty claim
		functional: certain universals make language more functional for human communication
	detection
		sampling
			size
				only currently spoken/well-documented extinct languages
				examples of every kind of structure
				impractical to have every language
			types
				opportunistic, percentage based, independent language, genera-based
		biases
			genetic bias: indo-european overrepresentation
			areal bias: languages in same area may share features due to contact
	1. more about languages grouped than indicator sorts by, multiple things in common
	2. check notes
	3. check notes
	4. check notes
	5. wals
	6. inflectional/fusional - one morpheme added to word indicates grammatical, agglutinative - several morphemes
	7. axis of fusion - increases with independent meanings per morpheme, axis of synthesis - increases with morphemes per word (analytic low both, polysynthetic high synth, agg/fusional in middle)
	8. inflectional morpheme on head, dependent, both, or alternate (head, dependent, double, split)
	
	2. certain word order, less placement flexibility, less complex inflection = more rigid
