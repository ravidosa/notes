# Hearing
peripheral auditory system
	outer ear
		pinna: reflects sound, causes spectral distortion
			sound localization
		ear canal: bandpass filter (1000-6000 Hz, frequencies of most speech)
	middle ear
		eardrum: thin taut membrane
		ossicles: connect eardrum to cochlea
			amplify sound pressure
			damp loud sound for lower frequencies
		eustachian tube: where air enters, causes air pressure differences
	inner ear
		semicircular canals: maintain balance
		cochlea: sounds transduced into neural signals
			thin, fluid-filled tube
			basilar membrane: resonance frequency decreases from base to apex
				pressure waves cause vibration, information about spectral content of sounds
				locations act as overlapping band-pass filters, characteristic frequency
			organ of corti: inner and outer hair cells connected to auditory nerve
				movement of basilar membrane disturbs hair cells, send signal to brain about location
				inner send information about motion to brain, outer change mechanical properties of basilar membrane
					motion of stereocilia
			tonotopic organization
				characteristic frequency for basilar membrane location, inner hair cell, auditory neuron
				auditory nerve has neural map of spectral content
	auditory nerve: send information from brain to ear
		neurons: transmit electrochemical signals
			fire more if signal meets threshold
			~30000 in auditory nerve
				afferent to inner, efferent to outer
			neural signals
				place coding
					information about frequency (location on basilar membrane)
					10-20 per location, attuned to characteristic frequency
				rate coding
					information about intensity of sound
					firing rate increases for stronger signal, more intense sound until hit maximum
					higher-base more sensitive, saturate faster
						nonlinear relationship between intensity and firing rate
				phase locking
					information about periodicity
					stereocilia depolarize at certain parts of wave, more likely to spike at certain point of cycle
central auditory system
	auditory centers
	primary auditory cortex: higher level processing
		connected to nerve fibers
		descending pathways: efferent connections to afferent fibers, perceptual learning
hearing impairment
	impaired ability to receive sounds, based on threshold for detecting pure tones
	audiogram: representation of hearing loss
	conductive loss: problems with conducting pressure variations from outer ear to cochlea
	sensorineural loss: dysfunction in cochlea/auditory nerve/brain
		presbycusis: sensorineural loss from aging
	congenital loss: hearing loss present from birth
	cochlear hearing loss: damage to hair cells in cochlea
		loss of sensitivity, high frequency regions most affected
	speech perception has less resolution for formants
		hearing aids: amplify sound entering ear canal, improve threshold problems
		cochlear implants: stimulate auditory nerve, improve sensitivity problems
			possible damage to auditory nerve
			poor pitch perception
		tinnitus: perception of sound in absence of external sound, associated with cochlear hearing loss
