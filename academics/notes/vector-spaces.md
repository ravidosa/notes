# Vector Spaces
## Subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$
vector addition, scalar multiplication
subspace
	closed under addition + scalar multiplication, contains zero vector
	proper subspace: not $\{0\}$ or $\mathbb{R}^n$
		distinct proper subspaces only have zero vector in common
linear maps preserve structure
### Fields
ring
	two binary operations
	addition commutative with identity $0$, multiplicative identity $1$
field
	ring with both operations associative and commutative, distributive
	identites not the same
	$\mathbb{Z} \backslash p\mathbb{Z}$ field for prime $p$
