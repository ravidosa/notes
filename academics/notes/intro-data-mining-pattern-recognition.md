# Vectors and Matrices in Data Mining and Pattern Recognition
## Data Mining and Pattern Recognition
data mining/pattern recognition: getting useful information from large data sets
## Vectors and Matrices
matrix: rectangular array of data with real scalar elements (for real-world applications)
	ex. term-document matrix, query vector
matrix as linear operator
	ex. handwriting classification
large, unstructured sets of data
	ex. page ranking
## Floating Point Computation
flop: floating point operation (counted separately)
error analysis
	IEEE single/double precision
	overflow/underflow
	error compounds
## Notation and Conventions
lowercase for vectors (bold for class), uppercase for matrices
$.$ for column vector
canonical unit vectors $e_i$
identity matrix $I$
