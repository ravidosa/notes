# Heavy Ion Reaction
higher density, more excited nuclei
	coulomb excitation below coulomb barrier, nuclear processes above
nuclear equation of state
relativistic heavy ion reactions
	QCD at high energy, recreate early universe
	confined vs deconfined color, degrees of freedom
	RHIC
		solenoidal tracker: track all charged hadron produced by collisions
		ions move along beam, form hot, anisotropic fireball after collision
		jets from hard scattering of partons
		evolution of semi-central collisions
			azimuthal distribution
			elliptic flow
