# P (complexity class)
$P = \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty TIME(n^k)$
	all problems decidable in polynomial time
	reasonably encoded: binary string
## Problems
$EULERIANCYCLE$: graph $G$ has eulerian cycle
	check degree of each node
$RELPRIME$ $x$ and $y$ relatively prime
	euclidean algorithm
$PATH$: graph $G$ has path from $s$ to $t$
	breadth-first search
$CONNECTED$: graph $G$ is connected
	check if path between every two nodes
