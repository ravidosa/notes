# Pragmatics
interpretation of expression
	language represents encoded information through sounds, letters, gestures
		non-iconic, information must be reconstructed
all utterances underspecified
	pragmatics: study of enriching conventionalized meanings of utterances beyond intended meanings
		nominal domain restriction, indexicals, gradable adjectives, scalar inferences, focus effects
	semantic-pragmatic interface
historical background
	language and logic
		linguistic form of argument (union)
		language unsystematic (separation)
			formal logic as language of thought
			no apparent systematicity
		systematizing language (reunion)
			chomsky and montague model language rigorously using logic
			grice: divergences also logical
gricean pragmatics
	cooperative principle: contribute to conversation as needed
	maxims: describe, not prescribe human behavior
		quality: say what you believe to be true
		quantity: be only as informative as needed
		relation: say something relevant
		manner: be brief and unambiguous
	opting out, flouting, clash
	how assumptions of maxims affect meaning
conversational implicature
	meaning that result from reasoning about rules of conversation, implied meaning
	tests
		cancellability
			target meaning explicitly cancellable if implicature
		suspension
			lack of knowledge about truth of target meaning,  implicature if consistent
		reinforcement
			target meaning implicature if not redundant
