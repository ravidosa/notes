# Basics of Articulation
language is discrete, combinatorial, unbounded
vowels and consonants formed from articulatory gestures
	airstream mechanism, state of larynx, state of velar port, place of articulation, manner of articulation
phonetic transcription: writing sounds using phonetic alphabet
	IPA chart
consonants
	airstream
		unmarked (pulmonic egressive) vs marked
	larynx
		voiced vs voiceless
	velum
		nasal vs oral
	manner of articulation
		obstruents: create obstruction
			plosives (oral stops), fricatives, affricates
		sonorants: resonate
			nasal stops, approximants
			almost always voiced
		stops completely close mouth
		fricatives almost close
		affricates combine stop and fricative
		approximants move to narrow vocal tract
	place of articulation
		labial: lower lip
			bilabial: both lips
			labiodental: lower lip and teeth
		coronal: tongue tip
			dental: tongue and teeth
			alveolar: tongue and alveolar ridge
			post-alveolar: tongue and roof of mouth behind alveolar ridge
			retroflex: tongue curls back
		dorsal: tongue body
			palatal: middle of tongue
			velar: tongue and velum
		laryngeal: larynx
vowels
	rounding, tongue body height and frontness
