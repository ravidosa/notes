# Particle Accelerator
produce beams of charged particles
	protons
		$K = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_pd}$ to probe dimension of length $d$
			for 1 femtometer, $K \approx 0.02m_pc^2$
	electrons (usual projectiles)
required to produce new particles, states
	no known limit on mass of produced states besides energy of reactant
cross sections (see [scattering](scattering.md))
van de graaf generators used to provide high energy
	not high enough for elementary particle research
center of mass energy
	particle A hits stationary particle B
		center of mass energy $W = \sqrt{2E_A^{lab}m_Bc^2 + (m_A^2 + m_B^2)c^4}$ ($\approx \sqrt{2E_A^{lab}m_Bc^2}$ for high-energy case)
	colliding beams
		higher $W$, more intensity needed
		beam storage and cooling
			particles cooled down, then focused
## Types
linear accelerators (linacs)
	particles accelerated in straight line
		length dependence inefficient
	beams
		radius of curvature $\rho = \frac{pc}{|q|B}$ (gaussian units)
		focusing done with quadrupole magnets
	superconducting linacs
synchotrons
	developed from cyclotron (similar, lower energies)
	particles accelerated in circle, field strength increases
		$B = \frac{pc}{|q|\rho}$
		$P = \frac{2e^2c}{3R^2}\frac{\beta^4}{(1 - \beta^2)^2}$ ($\approx \frac{2e^2c}{3R^2}\gamma^4$ for relativistic)
