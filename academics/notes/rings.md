# Rings
## Definition of a Ring
ring $R$
	abelian group under $+$
	closed with identity under $\times$
		set of invertible elements of ring form group
		$0$ never invertible
	multiplication distributes over addition
	zero ring: $1 = 0$
	unit: element with multiplicative inverse in ring
subring: subgroup but for rings
ex. gaussian integers $a + bi$ for $a, b, \in \mathbb{Z}$
subring generated by $\alpha$ $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$
	sums and differences of nonnegative integer powers of $\alpha$
		$\beta = \sum_{i=0}^n a_n\alpha^n$
algebraic: root of nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients (transcendental otherwise)
## Polynomial Rings
polynomial with coefficients in ring $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_nx^n$ where $a_i \in R$
	set $R[x]$, determined y coefficient vector
	monomials $x^i$, independent
	degree: largest $n$ where $a_n$ nonzero ($a_n$ is leading coefficient, monic if $a_n = 1$)
$R[x]$ has commutative ring structure
	$R$ is subring of $R[x]$ (constant polynomials)
division, factoring
	see [Polynomials](polynomials.md)
extendable to multivariate polynomials
	total degree: sum of degrees
	homogenous: all monomials of same degree
		can make polynomial homogenous by tacking on extra variable
## Homomorphisms and Ideals
similar to group homomorphism
	$\varphi(a + b) = \varphi(a) + \varphi(b), \varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)$
	same for ring isomorphism
ex. map to mod $p$ congruence class
substitution principle
	homomorphism mapping from $R[x]$ to $R$ from substituting $\alpha \in R$ for $x$
	kernel is polynomials with $\alpha$ as root
only one homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $R$
ideal $I$: nonempty subset of $R$ closed under addition, multiplication by $r \in R$ (analogous to linear combinations)
	kernel of homomorphism is ideal
	principal ideal: multiples of $\alpha \in R$ (every ideal principal in $\mathbb{Z}$)
	unit ideal $R = (1)$, zero ideal $(0)$ (proper ideal if not these)
$R$ is field if exactly $2$ ideals ($(0)$ and $(1)$)
	every ideal principal in $F[x]$ for field $F$, contains unique monic polynomial of minimal degree
polynomial gcd
	see [Polynomials](polynomials.md)
	characteristic: nonnegative integer generator of $\mathbb{Z}$ to $R$ mapping
# Quotient Rings
quotient ring $R / I$ with cosets $\overline{\alpha} = [\alpha + I]$ (also a ring)
