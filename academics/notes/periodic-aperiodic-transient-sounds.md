# Periodic, Aperiodic, and Transient Sounds
## Periodic Sounds
periodic: repeat after given time (period)
	$f(x) = f(x + p)$ for period $p$
	"musical" quality
	one frequency component = simple, multiple frequency components = complex
	pitch: "highness"/"lowness"
		fundamental frequency $f_0$: rate of pattern repeat
			affects pitch of complex tones
			only contain multiples of $f_0$, $f_0$ is gcd of harmonic components
	timbre: "quality", "feel" (not pitch, loudness)
		spectral envelope: distribution of energies across component frequencies
		phonetic content, vowel quality (height, frontness, phonetic variation)
	tone: relatively simple, constant pitch and timbre
		pure tone: specific timbre
	periodic*: look roughly same over 3-5 cycles
	harmonics
		all periodic sounds have harmonics, energy at harmonics
## Aperiodic Sounds
aperiodic: do not repeat at any fixed interval
noise
	unpredictable variability
	no harmonic structure, musicality, pitch
	white noise
		flat spectrum
		stable intensity
		color of noise (red to blue)
	band-limited noise
		limit energy to frequency band
		acoustic filter
		narrowed band becomes sinusoid
	shaped noise
		based on shape of spectral envelope
transient sounds
	very short, large change in amplitude
	impulse (dirac delta), flat spectrum
