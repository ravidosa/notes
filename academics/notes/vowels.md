# Vowels
syllable: grouping of segments
	syllable nucleus: open articulation
	syllabic consonants: onset before, coda after
	stress: prominent, longer, higher-pitched
## Vowel Acoustics and Articulation
speech sounds produced without obstruction in vocal tract
differentiated by location of tongue in mouth
	height: height of tongue in mouth with respect to roof
	frontness: proximity of tongue to front of mouth with respect to teeth
	changing size of front/back cavity affects vowel acoustics
formants: resonance frequencies of vocal tract
	numbered by frequency (F1, F2, etc)
vowel quadrilateral
	F1 inversely related to vowel height
	F2 directly related to vowel frontness
vowel quality
	monophthongs: static tongue position, single point
	diphthongs: tongue/formants moves, line segment
lip rounding
	front usually unrounded, back rounded
	extends vocal tract, decreases formant frequencies (F3)
nasality
	velum up = oral, velum down = nasal
duration more phonological, language specific
### Vowel Acoustics and Vowel Quality
vowel quality primarily determined by F1, F2 (partially F3)
F3 contributed more to perception of speaker size
vowel plot
	read F1 and F2 from spectrum
	F1 vs F2
	F1 = 500 is mid (< low, > high)
	F2 = 1300 is central (< back, > front)
	investigate organization of vowel systems
		cross-dialect, cross-language, cross-generational comparison
### Formant Tracking in Praat
clicking on spectrogram estimates frequency, high variance in measurement
	linear predictive coding
fast track: automatic formant tracker, vowel plot
	take n steps, select smoothest analysis
	generate plot from table
### Formants and Harmonics
both formants (peaks in spectral envelope) and harmonics (individual components)
	combine to form spectrum of vowel
glottal source spectrum
	spectral envelope inferred from relative power of harmonics, vowel identification
		easier with widely distributed frequency components
## Tones
intonation used in all languages
marked with tone letters
## Positional Variation in English  Vowels
