# History of Modern Physics
unexplained phenomena beyond classical newtonian mechanics + maxwellian electromagnetic theory
einsteinâ€™s annus mirabilis (1905): photoelectric effect, brownian motion, special relativity, mass-energy equivalence
electromagnetic waves
speed of light + ether
	speed of light - 299792458 m/s
	definition of second - 9192631770 cycles of radiation from Cs-133
	definition of meter - distance traveled by radiation from Cs-133 in a vaccuum in 1/299792458 of a second
atomic spectra
## The Photoelectric Effect
monochromatic light on electrode
current flow above certain frequency
current stop above certain voltage
$K_e = eV_{stop}=hf - \phi$
## Blackbody Radiation
planck relation: $E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \mathrm{eV\cdot nm}}{\lambda}$ for $h = 6.626 * 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}$
## X-Rays and Radioactivity
bremsstrahlung
	high energy electron accelerated after passing by electric field of nucleus
	accelerated charges radiate photons
## The Compton Effect
photon momentum
	$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = pc$, so $p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$
compton scattering
	high energy photon hits electron
	loss of energy from photon to electron
	$\lambda'-\lambda = \frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\cos\theta)$
	compton wavelength of electron is 2.43 pm (when $\theta = 0$)
## Pair Production
$e^+e^-$ pair conversion
	high energy (twice rest mass energy of electron) photon turns into electron positron pair after passing by heavy nucleus
	creates antimatter
matter-antimatter annihilation
	positron and electron form positronium, annihilate into two photons (~0.125 ns)
photon hits matter, energy absorbed by photoelectric effect, compton scattering, $e^+e^-$ pair conversion
electromagnetic showers
	initial photon creates $e^+e^-$ pair, which create bremsstrahlung photons, and so on
	determine energy of gamma ray
## Wave-Particle Duality
wave/particle nature of light
	photons are like wave packets
	quantum uncertainty
		no definite position or wavelength
		properties of both particle and wave
double slit experiment
	beam of photons form interference pattern at two slits
	electrons behave similarly
	bragg diffraction
		$n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta$
