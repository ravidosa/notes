nuclei
	neutron = 939.37 MeV/c^2
	proton = 938.28 MeV/c^2
	free neutrons unstable, decay to proton, electron, neutrino
		unstable even when bonded (nuclear decay)
			hydrogen vs deuterium vs tritium
	atomic number A = protons Z + neutrons N
		multiple isotopes (N) for given Z
		more neutrons as Z increases
		nucleus will decay if energetically favorable
		atomic mass unit (amu/u) = 1.66 * 10^-27 kg (C-12) = 931493614.838475 eV
			atomic mass includes electrons, nuclear mass in appendix I
			1 u <m_p, m_n (binding energy)
			use every digit
	nuclear size
		protons, neutrons not pointlike ($R_0=1.2 fm$)
		size of heavy nuclei $r=R_0A^\frac{1}{3}$
	nuclear binding
		strong nuclear force
			color charge
				protons and neutrons color neutral
				induce small color charge moment in each other in proximity
				internucleonic force small range
			nucleon nucleon bonding
				only np (no nn or pp)
				binding strongest when spins aligned (pauli exclusion principle)
				most loosely bound = deuterium, 2.2MeV
				binding energy
					dependent on strong attraction, coulomb repulsion, pauli exclusion
					per nucleon
						grows rapidly with Z, peaks at iron (8.8 MeV/nucleon), then decreases
		nuclear mass
			$M_{Z,A}=Z_{m_p}+(A-Z)m_n+B_{Z,A}$
		nuclear magnetic resonance
			spin → angular momentum → magnetic moment
			moment precesses at characteristic frequency
			perturb rf field, induce change in nuclear spin
		nuclear decay
			alpha: Z → Z-2, N → N-2, emission of $\alpha$ (4He nucleus)
			beta
				Z → Z+1, N → N-1, emission of $\beta^-$ (electron)
				Z → Z-1, N → N+1, emission of $\beta^+$ (positron)
			gammas: excited nucleus decays to lower energy state, emits ~1 MeV photon
			fission: heavy nucleus splits into lighter nuclei and free neutrons (rare)
				controlled vs uncontrolled chain reactions
				critical, supercritical, subcritical
				U235
					not a lot, hard to enrich, easy to bomb
				Pu239
					not in nature, cyclotron, hard to bomb
				nuclear reactor
					stable, critical reaction
					generate steam, drive turbine generator
					accelerator driven subcritical
						leave the united states for asia
			fusion: ??
			$N(t)=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$ for decay constant $\lambda=\frac{\ln 2}{t_{\frac{1}{2}}}$
			becquerel = 1 decay/second, 1 curie = 37billion Bq
