# Unbound States
potential step
	classical dependent on conservation of energy
incident, reflected, transmitted
	inc refl same wavelength, trans longer + lower energy
	probability ($E > U_0$)
		$T = \frac{\sqrt{E(E-U_0)}}{(\sqrt{E} + \sqrt{E-U_0})^2}$, $R = \frac{(\sqrt{E} - \sqrt{E-U_0})^2}{(\sqrt{E} + \sqrt{E-U_0})^2}$
		finite barrier
			resonant transmission: $k'L = n\pi$
	if $E < U_0$, no transmission, fully reflection
		penetration of barrier
	finite barrier, $E > U_0$
		probabilities for transmission and reflection
			same wavelength before and after (longer in barrier), lowered amplitude
		resonant transmission
			$E - U_0 = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$
boundary conditions
	bound has discrete energies, unbound has any energy greater than $U_0$
	$v \propto k$
finite barrier, $E < U_0$
	same wavelength before and after (longer in barrier), lowered amplitude
	particle tunneled through barrier
	bigger barrier, smaller tunneling probability
	$T \approx 16\frac{E}{U_0}(1-\frac{E}{U_0})e^{-2L\sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar}(U_0-E)}}$
alpha decay
	heavy nucleus decays by emitting alpha particle
	lifetime = tunneling probability
fusion in stars
	usually elastic scattering, 1/10^28 produces deuterium
TFET (tunneling field effect transistors)
particle-wave propagation
	group velocity $\frac{d\omega}{dk}$, phase velocity$\frac{\omega_0}{k_0}$
	$\Psi(x,t) = Ae^{i(k_0x-\omega_0t)}2\cos((dk)x-(d\omega)t) = \int_{i\infty}^{\infty}A(k)e^{i(kw-\omega t)}dk$
		$\omega(k) =c$ for EM wave, $\omega(k) = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}$ for massive nonrelativistic particle
		$A(k)$ creates gaussian shape
	dispersion: wave spreads out
		if $\frac{d^2\omega}{dk^2} \neq 0$
		em waves no dispersion, matter waves dispersion
