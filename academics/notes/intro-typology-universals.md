# Introduction to Typology and Universals
language universals: core properties that languages have in common
	result from commonalities in functioning of language
typology: classification of (components of) languages based on shared formal characteristics
	relies on cross-linguistic comparison
		cross-linguistic patterns, connections
	formal features convey meaning
classification types
	genetic (common origin)
	areal: shared by location, not necessarily from proto-language
		languages adopt features of those close by
		sprachbund (balkans)
