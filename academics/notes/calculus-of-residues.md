# Calculus of Residues
$f$ analytic everywhere except finite $z_1,\ldots,z_n$
	ex. rational function $\frac{p(z)}{q(z)}$
	$a_{-1} = R(f, z_i)$: residue at $z_i$
	residue theorem: $\oint f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i\sum_{i=1}^n R(f, z_i)$
		finding residues is summing integral
		laurent series converges uniformly and absolutely in every subannulus of the annulus of convergence
		annulus of convergence is distances to nearest singularities
