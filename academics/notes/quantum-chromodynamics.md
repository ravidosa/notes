# Quantum Chromodynamics
governed by strong force, mediated by gluon
## [Feynman Diagram](feynman-diagram.md)
primitive vertex: quark absorbing/emitting gluon, then exiting
	color may change, gluons bicolored
	three-gluon, four-gluon vertices
		glueballs
fine structure constant $\alpha > 1$
	asymptotic freedom: small at small distances
