# Modular Form
exceptional value: value not in range of complex function
	picard's first theorem: if nonconstant and entire, at most one exceptional value
		picard's second theorem: if analytic with essential singularity, then at most one exceptional value on every punctured neighborhood of singularity
	landau radius: if analytic on $\Delta_R$ with exceptional values $0, 1$ and $f'(0) \neq 0$, then $R \leq \frac{1 - |\tau(a_0)|^2}{|\tau'(a_0)||a_1|}$ where $\tau$ is germ of covering map
there exists covering from $\Delta$ to region that is not plane or plane without a point
schottky's theorem: holomorphic function with $0, 1$ as exceptional values can be bounded by $z, f(0)$
montel's theorem: if locally uniformly bounded, then normal
	normal families: every sequence of analytic functions in family has locally uniformly converging subsequence
	montel's second theorem: $\mathcal{F}_{a,b}(\Omega)$ is normal if allowing local uniform convergence to constant at $\infty$
