# Projective Space
## $\mathbb{C}$
stereographic projection onto 3d sphere (riemann sphere)
complex projective space
	treat complex numbers as vectors
	1d complex projection space $P$ is distinct sets of vectors with same ratio
	best for [fractional linear transformations](fractional-linear-transformation.md)
analytic on complex manifold if restrictions analytic
mapping of unit disk to self, if $f(0) = 0$, $f(z) = cz$ by [schwarz's lemma](holomorphic-function.md)
schwarz reflection principle
	if defined on upper half plane with real values, extendable to conjugate
	$\tilde{f}(z) = \begin{cases} f(z) & z \in \Omega \cup \gamma \\ (f(z^*))^* & z \in \Omega^* \end{cases}$
		for FLT $S, T$, $S(\tilde{f}(T^{-1}(z)))$ is analytic
	morera's theorem: if $f$ continuous on disk with closed curve line integrals zero, $f$ is analytic
modulus of annulus: $\frac{R}{r^2}$
	moduli space $\mathbb{R}_{>1}$
simply connected open proper subset biholomorphic to unit disk, $f(0) = z_0, f'(0)$ real and positive (riemann mapping theorem)
	two simply connected proper subsets always biholomorphic
	annuli biholomorphic iff $\frac{R}{r}$ same
### Hyperbolic Space
isometric on biholomorphic maps
	$d(z, w) = \frac{1}{2}\log\frac{1 + D}{1 - D}, D = |\frac{zw}{1 - \overline{z}w}|$
