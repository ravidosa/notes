# Particle Detector
data collected: # of particles, [4-momenta][four-vector.md], identity, event topology
ideal detector
	excellent $e, \mu$ identification
	high energy resolution, slim gaussian
	energy of jets
	$4\pi$ coverage
	reconstruct muon tracks
	microvertex detector, micron level position resolution
	continuous recording of high rates
	real: balance mechanical stability w precision, etc
geometry
	fixed target (magnetic spectrometer)
		limited angle coverage, easy access
	collider ($4\pi$ multipurpose)
		full angle coverage restricted access
arrangement
	vertex -> tracking -> id -> calorimetry -> manet coil -> hadron calorimetry -> muon id
	density increases, precision and granularity decrease
magnet geometry
	solenoid (CMS)
		large homogenous inside, weak outside
		size, cost limitations
	toroid (ATLAS)
		large, non uniform fields over large volume
		low cost, complex structure
ionization energy loss 
	$-\frac{dE}{dx} \sim \frac{Z}{A}$
	$-\frac{dE}{dx} \sim \frac{1}{\beta^2}=2$ MeV/g cm^2 (low gamma, bethe-bloch)
		good for heavy projectiles, fails for low $\beta$, high $\gamma$
		$dE$ usually below bethe-bloch prediction
	plots shift w mass, electron very different, can use to id
mass measurement
	nuclei ground state vs excited state
	particle rest energy
	mass spectrometer
		ion beam: multiple isotopes
		velocity selector: balance electric and magnetic force to keep beam straight
		uniform B stage: different masses have different radius
		detector: photographic plate, etc
		works well for nuclei, not particles
	particles
		use $E^2 = p^2 + m^2$
		select particles with momentum, scintillation counter
	breit-wigner
		shape of resonance
lorentz invariant $s$
	$s = (\sum_i E_i)^2 - (\sum_i p_i)^2$
	center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$
interactions count
	cross section, integrate luminosity over time
bragg peak: depth of radiation penetration
cherenkov radiation: minimal energy loss
bremsstrahlung
	radiation length: energy decreases by factor of $e$
multiple scattering: beam spread
photons
	attenuation of intensity
	lost by interaction
		photoelectric, compton, pair production
