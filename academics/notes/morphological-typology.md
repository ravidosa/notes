# Morphological Typology
morphological parameters (sapir)
	index of synthesis: amount of affixation
		isolating: words monomorphemic
			complex tonal systems (mandarin, possibly areal)
			serial verbs: verb sequence with no relationship markers
			rigid word order
		synthetic: complete utterance only from affixing morphemes to root
			extensive affixation (bare)
			marking for agreement, voice, tense, aspect, valence, mood
			polysynthetic: extreme synthesis (southern tiwa)
				complex agreement systems
			noun incorporation: compounding
	index of fusion: ease of morpheme segmentation
		agglutinative: morphemes easily segmented
			nahautl
		inflectional/fusional: morphemes fuse together
			segmentation may seem possible (ancient greek)
		suppletive: no segmentable/invariant morphemes (impossible)
	relationship
		synthetic tends to be agglutinative
historical change (cyclical, hypothetical)
	phonological reduction transforms from isolating to agglutinative
	morphological fusion transforms from agglutinative to fusional
	morphological loss transforms from fusional to isolating
morphogical linkage
	government vs agreement
		government: head-dependent relationship from obligatory marking on dependent
		agreement: dependent in form matching head (both marked)
	head vs dependent marking (english, blackfoot vs hungarian, greek)
		head -> verb-initial, dependent -> verb-late
		double-marking: on both (turkish, arabic)
		split marking: roughly equal (bantu)
