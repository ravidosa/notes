# Subatomic Astrophysics
standard model of early universe
	redshift from expanding universe (hubble constant)
	big bang
	phase transitions
		vacuum to matter -> forces unify -> inflation -> weak/EM unify -> hadronization -> nucleosynthesis -> plasma to atoms
		gravity weakened, no longer unified
		GUT era
	inflationary scenario
		fixes horizon, flatness problems
		early universe energy density dominated by scalar field
dark matter, vacuum energy
	hot vs cold dark matter
	CP violations
primordial nucleosynthesis
	after significant cooling
	deuterium important indicator
	beta decay up to lithium (d, H, He, Li abundant)
	stellar energy
		CNO cycle: $_{12}C + 4p \rightarrow \alpha _{12}C$ (26.7 MeV energy released)
			dominates in hot stars
		PP cycle: $pp \rightarrow _3He\gamma$ 
			 same energy released, different reaction rates
		nuclear burning and contraction
			burning helium to produce oxygen, high density helium to beryllium
		neutron stars: cool down by neutrino emission, degeneracy pressure balances gravity
			pulsars
	beyond iron, formed by neutron capture
cosmic rays
	composed of nuclei, electrons, positrons, photons, neutrinos
	possibly from supernovae,	high energy sources unidentified
neutrino astronomy
	probing core of stars, search for dark matter (WIMPS)
leptogenesis
	possible explanation for baryon excess
		sphaleron preserves lepton-baryon number difference
	neutrinos majorana particles?
