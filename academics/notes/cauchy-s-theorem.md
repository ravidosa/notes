# Cauchy's Theorem
cauchy-goursat theorem: if analytic in simply connected open set, line integral over every closed curve is zero
	cauchy integral formula: $f^{(n)}(z) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{f(w)}{(w -z)^{n+1}} dw$
	same for every positively oriented curve that winds around $z$ once
weak max principle: if $f$ analytic in closed ball, $f$ bounded by $M$
	[max principle](holomorphic-function.md): analytic function has max modulus on boundary (also min if no zeros)
cauchy's inequality: if $f$ analytic in closed ball, $f^{(n)}$ bounded by $\frac{n!}{R^n}M$
liouville's theorem: every bounded entire function is constant
	fundamental theorem of algebra: complex polynomial of degree $n \geq 1$ has at least one root
morera: if $f$ continuous and line integral over every closed curve is zero, then $f$ analytic
