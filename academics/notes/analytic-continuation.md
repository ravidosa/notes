# Analytic Continuation
uniqueness theorem for [analytic functions](holomorphic-function.md)
	i analytic in region and infinite set of zeros with limit point in region, then identically zero
	when functions agree on nonempty open subset, agree on whole region
continuation sequence
	sequence of pairings of functions and open disks (analytic section)
	nonempty intersection, functions agree between consecutive
	continuation along arc
		points on arc lie in disk
		roughly in order
		parametrizations equivalent when map between intervals
analytic continuation along arc if continuation sequence admissible for arc
germ
	set of function/disk pairs that agree with main function in intersection
	continuations have same germ if agree in intersection
	composition of germs is germ, same for continuation sequence
if analytic continuation for function then also for derivative, integral, composition with entire, polynomial of derivatives
