# Particle Decay
particles decay into lighter particles, unless prevented by some [conservation law](conservation-law-particle.md)
stable particles: photon, proton, lightest neutrino (and [antiparticles](history-particle-physics.md#antiparticles))
	most particles unstable, spontaneously decay
		mean lifetime $\tau = \frac{t_{1/2}}{\ln 2}$
		decays governed by [fundamental force](fundamental-interaction.md)
			identify force by decay lifetime (weak > electromagnetic > strong)
		larger mass difference, faster decay
## Decay Rate
decay rate $\Gamma$: probability per unit time of decay
	$N(t) = N(0)e^{-\Gamma t}, \tau = \frac{1}{\Gamma}$
	total decay rate is sum of individual decay rates
		branching ratios
