# Morphemes
morpheme: minimal unit in language
	root: central idea
	bound (must co-occur) vs free (appears on own)
		primarily phonological
	bound morphemes
		affixes
			prefixes (affixed to front) vs suffixes (affixed to end)
			also infixes (between), circumfixes (around), reduplication, suprafixing (tone/stress)
			preference for suffixes
				faster comprehension in processing
			grammaticalization: free morpheme semantically generalized, phonologically reduced into bound affix
				usually for suffixes
derivational vs inflectional morphology
	derivational
		semantic info
		new concept
		closer to root
	inflectional
		grammatical info
		more productive
		meaning predictable
		noun
			number > case
		verb
			root > voice > aspect > tense > moon > person/number
