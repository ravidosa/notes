# Continuous Function
connected set: any points connectable by path
topology: characterization of convergence using open sets
	analysis
		prove approximation of sequence lies in compact set
		obtain convergent subsequence
		prove limit is exact solution
	see [Basic Topology of R](topology-r.md)
		infinite union/finite intersection of open is open
		infinite intersection/finite union of closed is closed
		deleted neighborhood: $O \backslash \{z_0\}$
	boundary of $E$, $\partial E = E \subseteq \mathbb{C}$
		set of points where every neighborhood has points in $E$ and $E^c$ (compare to limit points)
		closed sets: sets containing boundary
	integral as unique limit of riemann sum
