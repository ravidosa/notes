# Shell Model
ionization potential: max at full shels (He, Ne, etc)
separation energy $S_n$
	$S_n(Z, N) = B(Z, N) - B(Z, N - 1)$
	difference in binding energy between nuclei
	tighter binding for even $N$
	even-even nuclei have $0$ spin empirically
		large jump at $N = 82$ (closed shell, less tightly bound)more at $2, 8, 20, 28$
shell model
	nucleons move independently in spherical potential
	closed shell spherically symmetric, zero total angular momentum, especially stable
	stable isotopes, isotones
magic numbers
	$2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126$
	binding energy, isotope stability
	small electric dipole moment
	more stable isotopes/isotones at these numbers
		double magic
	from [3d quantum harmonic oscillator](quantum-harmonic-oscillator.md)
		oscillator shells have dynamical degeneracy
		nucleon spin: half-integer spin of shell state
			interaction with orbital angular momentum, increases with $A$
				$V_{\ell s} = C_{\ell s}\vec{L} \cdot \vec{S}$
spin-parity
	predict with shell model
	ground state
		count the odd one
	excited states
		move nucleons around
