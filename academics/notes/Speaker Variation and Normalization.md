### Essentialist Ideology in Phonetics
vowel normalization algorithm: map from acoustic to linguistic
	sounds (real) vs phonetic properties (phenomenological)
	calibrate against human judgements
	overnormalization: erasure of legitimate phonetic/social variation
		nearey-e vs lobanov (scatter reduction)
		represent phonetic variation regardless of source, erase only non-phonetic acoustic variation
essentialism vs constructivism
	essentialism: characteristics of members of category necessary, relate to essence of category
		social, racial, gender essentialism
			sex vs gender
				sex based on anatomy, gender based on cultural practices
				both socially constructed and historically contingent
				anatomical vs social variation
				sex vs body + gender
		linguistic essentialism: speech of members of category necessary, relate to essence of category
			prescriptive: group must produce certain speech
			proscriptive: group cannot produce certain speech
	constructivism: characteristics of members historically and socially contingent, not related to essence of category
		linguistic universality: language faculty not language-specific
			apply to all aspects of grammar
			body limits physical acoustic characteristics, but not linguistic/phonetic properties
