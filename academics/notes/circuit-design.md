# Circuit Design
the spice is life
photolithography
hand drawn → computerized layout
audio amplifier
	emitter amplifier
	class A → single switching
		linear, but inefficient
	class B → pnp and npn combined, sep element for half
		efficient, but cross over distortion
	class AB → both at crossover
		more linear than B, but slight less efficient
	class C → single output active for half of cycle
		very efficient, only for resonant systems
differential amplifiers
	noise from induced emf in ground loop
