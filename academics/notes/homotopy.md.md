# Homotopy
$z(0, t) = z_0(t), z(1, t) = z_1(t), z(s, 0) = \alpha, z(s, 1) = \beta$
	equivalence relation
if both in region, homotopic with respect to region
monodromy theorem
	if homotopic, continuations have same terminal germ
simply connected if curves homotopic whenever mutual endpoints
	analytic function with germ
