# Conservation Law (particle physics)
kinematic conservation laws
	conservation of energy and momentum
	conservation of angular momentum
dynamical conservation laws
	conservation of charge
	conservation of color
	conservation of baryon number
	conservation of lepton number
	conservation of flavor
		approximate for weak interactions
	OZI rule
		gluons must be soft (low energy)
