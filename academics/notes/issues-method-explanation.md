# Issues of Method and Explanation
types of universals
	absolute: all languages have property
	implicational: if property, then second property
	explanation
		internal (grammatical rules)
			pragmatic marking of atypical sentence structure
		external (social context)
			discourse, processing time, economy (pronoun-drop, redundancy, automatization), perception-cognition (lexical semantics, colors), iconicity
		common genetic origin: speculative, untestable
		innateness: chomsky, empty claim
			universal grammar: innate human language faculty
				see [Views on Grammar](theory-english-syntax#views-on-grammar)
		functional: certain universals make language more functional for human communication
	detection
		sampling
			size
				SVO most common in greenberg, really SOV
				only currently spoken/well-documented extinct languages
				examples of every kind of structure
				impractical to have every language
			types
				opportunistic
				percentage based
				independent language
					no repetition of linguistic area
				genera based
					genera: language families reconstructed to same depth of time
		biases
			genetic bias: indo-european overrepresentation
			areal bias: languages in same area may share features due to contact

| universals | absolute | nonabsolute |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| nonimplicational | *all languages* have vowels | *nearly all* languages have nasal consonants |
| implicational | *if* 1st/2nd person reflexive, *then* 3rd person reflexive | *if* SOV, *then probably* postpositions |
