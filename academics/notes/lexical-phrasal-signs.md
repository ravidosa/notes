# Lexical and Phrasal Signs
## Linguistic Signs and Constructions
signs: arbitrary and conventional pairings of form and meaning
	sign based construction grammar (SBCG): language is infinite set of signs/constructs
	analyze words and phrases as signs
	describe words, phrases, and word classes with lexical descriptions
	constructions combine lexical and phrasal signs
	ditransitive construction
		two objects
idiomaticity continuum

| words                   | fixed idioms | idioms with variables | comparative conditional | subject-predicate |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| simple word-level signs | unchanging phrase | changing phrase |                         |                   |

identify contructions needed to describe syntactic combinations and rules that govern combination of words and phrases
## Lexical Signs
lexemes: basic unit of syntax, abstract sign that captures form-meaning correspondence
	word: inflected instationations of lexeme
		word -> clause -> phrase -> sentence
	group into classes based on parts of speech
	syntactic categories based on meaning, morphological form, and syntactic function
	lexical categories
		N (noun)
		V(AUX -) (main verb)
		V(AUX +) (auxiliary verb)
		A (adjective)
		Adv (adverb)
		P (preposition)
		Part (particle)
		Det (determiner)
		C (complementizer)
		Conj (conjunction)
	lexicon
		list of categorized words
constituents
	group words into larger phrasal units
	cleft test ("it is/was X that")
		emphasizable/focusable
	stand-alone test
		response to wh-question
	proform replacement
		refer to constituent
## Phrase Structure Rules
noun phrase NP
	NP -> (Det) A*/AP* N (PP/S)
verb phrase VP
	VP -> V (NP) (A/PP/S/VP)
	VP -> V (NP) (PP*/S/CP)
	VP -> VP Adv/PP
	VP -> VP AdvP
	VP -> V NP AP
	VP -> V NP NP
	VP -> V[AUX+] VP
adjective phrase AP
	AP -> A (PP/VP/CP)
adverb phrase AdvP
	AdvP -> (AdvP) Adv
preposition phrase PP
	PP -> P NP
complementizer phrase CP and conjunction phrase ConjP
	CP -> C S
	ConjP -> Conj S
recursive application
	hierarchical structures of words
multi-word exprerssions
	fixed expressions = single word, triangle
	semi-fixed expression = note semantic meaning
