# Higgs Boson
resolves violation of unitarity in $W^+W^- \to W^+W^-$
	longitudinally polarized
	maintains gauge symmetry
lagrangians in QFT (noether's theorem)
	scalar field: $\mathcal{L}_S = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)(\partial_\mu\phi) - \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi$
	free-particle dirac: $\mathcal{L}_D = i\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi - m\bar{\psi}\psi$
	EM: $\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} - j^\mu A_\mu$
local gauge invariance: use covariant derivative
	$\mathcal{L}_{QED} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - m_e)\psi + e\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi A_\mu - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$
	broken by particle mass terms (problematic for weak)
