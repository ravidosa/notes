# Winding Number
winding number of curve $n(\gamma, w) = \frac{\zeta(1) - \zeta(0)}{2\pi i} = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma}\frac{dz}{z - w}$ independent of continuation
	parametrization $\zeta(t)$
	if $\gamma$ closed, $n(\gamma, w) = 0$
argument principle
	if $f$ analytic, $n(f(\gamma), 0)$ is number of zeros
open mapping theorem
	image of region under nonconstant analytic is open set
