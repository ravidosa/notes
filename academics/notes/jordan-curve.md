# Jordan Curve
jordan curve: continuous one-to-one image of closed interval
	if image of circle, then closed jordan curve
	bounded region with jordan curve boundary is jordan region
jordan curve theorem: closed jordan curve divides plane into inside and outside, with simply connected inside
one-to-one mapping $f$ of jordan curve to $\Delta$, if $w_n$ converge to boundary point then $f(w_n)$ converges to $z$ where $|z| = 1$
	possible to define mapping on boundary points such that continuous
fejer's theorem: represent mapping of $\Delta$ to jordan region as fourier series
