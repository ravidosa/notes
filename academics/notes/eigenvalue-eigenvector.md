# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
eigenvector $\vec{V}$, eigenvalue $\lambda$
	$M\vec{\psi} = \vec{\psi}' = \lambda\vec{\psi}$
	if $\vec{\psi }$ is eigenvector, so is $c\vec{\psi}$
	characteristic equation
		non-trivial solutions
		$|M-\lambda I| = 0$
		as many eigenvalues as rows/columns
		normalized eigenvector → terms squared sum to 1
		eigenvectors real and orthogonal (scalar product is 0) → symmetric matrix (real symmetric vs hermitian)
diagonalizing matrix (by similarity transformation)
	matrix multiplied by matrix of eigenvectors is matrix of eigenvectors multiplied by diagonal matrix of eigenvalues ($C^{-1}MC = D)$
$M = CDC^{-1}$
