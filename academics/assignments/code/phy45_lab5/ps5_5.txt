Newton's method:
Pros
- converges faster (quadratic)
- can find roots that are close together
Cons
- can overshoot point depending on slope and proximity of guess to root
- requires function to be defined and differentiable over relevant interval

Bisection method:
Pros
- does not require derivative to compute next iteration
- no conditions for function
Cons
- requires function to cross x-axis to find root
- converges slower (linear)
