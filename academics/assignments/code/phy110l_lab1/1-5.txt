The potential of a charge distribution is relatively easier to compute.
To directly compute the electric field, two values must be stored for each position, rather than only one for the potential.
It is also harder to integrate from an arbitrary zero point along a path to find the potential.
The weakness of the potential lies in the difficulty of computing forces, which would be far easier if charges computed their own fields.
