When the projectile hits the ground, it has traveled 20 meters, placing it at x = 20.
The same happens when m = 7, as the range is not dependent on mass.
This makes sense, as in classical mechanics:
x(t) = vx0*t = 5t
y(t) = vy0*t + 1/2*a*t^2 = 19.6t - 4.9t^2
y(t) = 0 = 19.6t - 4.9t^2 = 4.9t(4 - t)
t = 0, 4
x(4) = 20
The computed value for the range agrees with the value calculated using principles of classical mechanics.
