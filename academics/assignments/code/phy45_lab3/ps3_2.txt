The period of oscillation is approximately 1, which makes sense as the period of the sine function in the analytical solution is:
2pi/(sqrt(k/m - (b/2m)^2))
= 2pi/(sqrt(10/0.25 - (0.15/2*0.25)^2))
= 0.9946
The peaks of the oscillations also fall off as the exponential function in the analytical solution:
e^(-b/2m)
= e^(-0.15/2*0.25)
= e^-0.3
x starts off at 3 and begins to oscillate between negative and positive values,
but due to damping, never reaches the maximum amplitude of 3 again.
