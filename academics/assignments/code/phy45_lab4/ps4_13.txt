The distances from the origin for most of the walks fall within a reasonable bound of the expected distance.
The mean expected distance is (0.45-0.55)*400 = -40, with sqrt(400) = 20 being a resonable deviation from that expected distance.
Even the walks that do not fall within the expected distance are not far outside the range, and would fall within two deviations froms the mean.
