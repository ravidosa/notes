The funny participation ratio is around 4, while the rest are around 170.
The funny eigenvalue is around 14.
The eigenvector with the funny participation ratio is the same as the eigenvector with the funny eigenvalue.
This makes sense as for that eigenvector, the masses are moving a lot more, so the participation ratio will be a lot smaller.
