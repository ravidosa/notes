The localized mode is not present when the defective spring constant is smaller than the others.
This makes sense, as a higher constant defective spring is more resistive to motion, and does not want to move as the other springs,
but the lower constant defective spring is less resistive to motion, and can move as the other springs do.
The higher constant defective spring dominates, making the system behave as one spring,
but the lower constant defective spring is dominated, behaving as an empty space.
