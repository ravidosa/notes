Having a system of springs with periodic boundary conditions can be compared to connecting the ends to each other,
forming a circular chain of masses connected by springs.
Consequently, the position of the defect does not matter, as every position can be rotated to match any other position,
so all of the eigenvalues will be the same regardless of the position.
