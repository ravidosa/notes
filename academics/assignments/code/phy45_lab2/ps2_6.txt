The trapezoidal rule is a closer approximation to the exact answer of 39,
returning 39.045 as opposed to the original implementation's 35.895 for N=10 and 39.00045 to the original's 38.68545 for N=100.
A trapezoid approximates the area under the curve more closely than a rectangle.
Using SImpson's and Boole's rules further improve on this result.
