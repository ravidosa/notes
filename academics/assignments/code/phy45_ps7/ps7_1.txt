The plot is no longer symmetrical, which makes sense as the top edge is no longer symmetrical.
THe potential increases for some time as x increases, then decreases,
which is reasonable given the boundary conditions on the left and right sides.
This problem can be solved analytically. The solution for the following boundary conditions
- V=0 at x=0 (0<y<L_y)
- V=0 at y=0 (0<x<L_x)
- V=0 at x=L_x (0<y<L_y)
- V=3x at y=L_y (0<x<L_x)
is:
V(x,y) = sum for n=1,2,3... 18*(-1)**(n-1)/(n*pi*sinh(n*pi*2/3))*sin(n*pi*x/3)*sinh(n*pi*1/3)
