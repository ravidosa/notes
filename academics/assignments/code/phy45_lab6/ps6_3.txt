The code takes more iterations to get a good result because it takes more iterations for the boundary
potential to percolate to the other side, as the number of boxes to travel through has been increased.
For 10000 iterations, the code takes around fifty seconds to run.
This makes sense, as on the order of (3/0.01*2/0.01)*(2*100000+2) operations are performed,
which would result in a 3 GHz processor taking on the order of 4.00004 seconds to run the code.
For dx = 0.001, it shold take 1000000 iterations to get a good result.
As on the order of (3/0.001*2/0.001)*(2*10000000+2) operations are performed,
a 3 GHz processor should take on the order of 40000.004 seconds to run the code.
