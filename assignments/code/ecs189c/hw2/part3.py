Part 3: Pigeonhole Principle

This part will explore two limitations of Z3:

1. Sometimes, Z3 gets the right answer, but takes a long time to do so,
    or even hangs indefinitely.
2. Sometimes, Z3 can't prove a statement at all, and returns UNKNOWN.

=== What is the pigeonhole principle? ===

This is a principle that says the following:

"If you have n+1 pigeons and they are in n holes,
then at least one hole has more than one pigeon."

For example, if you put 4 pigeons in 3 holes,
then at least one hole has at least 2 pigeons.

Example:
|     |     |     |
|     |  o  | ooo |
-------------------

Above, the first hole has 0 pigeons, the second hole has 1 pigeon,
and the third hole has 3 pigeons. So the third hole has more than
one pigeon.

We will consider two different encodings of the pigeonhole principle.
The first encoding is for a fixed number of pigeons and holes.
The second encoding is for a general number of pigeons and holes.
These will be examples of limitations (1) and (2) above.

=== First encoding ===

The first encoding is for a fixed number of pigeons and holes.
You will be asked to write two functions:

1. pigeons_in_holes(m, n):
    Input:
        m is a Python integer (the number of pigeons)
        n is a Python integer (the number of holes)

Returns:
    A formula that says that there are m total pigeons in n holes.

2. two_in_hole(m, n):
    Input:
        m is a Python integer (the number of pigeons)
        n is a Python integer (the number of holes)

    Returns:
        A formula that is true exactly when at least one hole has at least
        two pigeons

There are test cases that will help check that
your implementation is correct.

=== Second encoding ===

The result is what was expected. I think Z3 has troubles with this problem since quantifiers are involved, and Z3 is better suited for proposiional logic, not first-order logic, since the problem is unbounded.
